      "question": "What is a PIXEL art and how is it used?",
      "answer": "Pixel art is a form of digital art created through the use of software where images are edited at the pixel level. The aesthetic for this kind of graphic comes from 8-bit and 16-bit computers and video game consoles, in addition to other limited systems such as graphing calculators. In most pixel art, the colour palette used is extremely limited in size, with some pixel art using only two colors. Creating or modifying pixel art characters or objects for video games is sometimes called 'spriting'"
