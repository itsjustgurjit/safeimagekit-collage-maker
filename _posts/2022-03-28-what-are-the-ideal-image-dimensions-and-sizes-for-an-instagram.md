## **Learn about the size and aspect ratio of Instagram.**

When you share photos and videos on Instagram, there are two main things to consider: look ratio and height.

### **Instagram Aspect Ratio (Dimension)**

![It is expressed in the form of a ratio, like 4:5 or 9:16, where the first number represents the width and the second number represents the height.](/uploads/284.PNG "Instagram Aspect Ratio (Dimension)")

The image size refers to the width of an image concerning its height.

It is expressed in the form of a ratio, like 4:5 or 9:16, where the first number represents the width and the second number represents the height.

It's significant to make assured your photos and videos fall within Instagram's guidance. Otherwise, they'll be cut away to fit a backed ratio — which could affect part of your picture being lost.

Fortunately, Later's cropping tool has recommended ratios for Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter, so you can still make sure your posts are optimized ideally before publishing them.

### **Instagram Image Size (Resolution)**

Size (or resolution) is the number of pixels that compose the width and height of your picture or video.

Like the aspect ratio, size is expressed in two numbers - the first represents the width, and the second represents height.

For instance, a 1080px by 1080px image size is much larger than 50px by 50px.

Then why is the size of the picture on Instagram important?

While Instagram compresses your photos and videos, it's still better to share at optimal resolution. Thus, when Instagram compresses your photo size, it will not affect the image quality.

## **Instagram Post Size Guide1: Instagram Feed Posts.**

Once, the sizes of Instagram photos and videos were limited to the single square, but now (almost) everything has passed.

Sizes of Instagram messages now go from 16:9 all the way to 4:5!

### **Horizontals (16:9)**

![we recommend that you do the height of your horizontal photo at least 1080px. Thus, when Instagram compresses the file, the quality should remain high enough.](/uploads/282.PNG "Instagram Post Size Guide1: Instagram Feed Posts.")

Whereas Instagram recommends a post ratio of 1.91:1, you can actually go until 16:9.

Be that as it may, we recommend that you do the height of your horizontal photo at least 1080px. Thus, when Instagram compresses the file, the quality should remain high enough.

### **Square Posts (1:1)**

Even if Instagram supports horizontal and vertical photos, square posts continue to be a popular choice on Instagram, mainly since the Instagram profile grid produces a 1:1 ratio.

So how can we optimize for square?

We recommend that you take your square pictures 1080px by 1080px in size. When Instagram compresses the file, the version will remain of high quality.

### **Vertical Posts (4:5)**

Typically, your vertical pictures should have a 4:5 aspect ratio. Nothing longer (like 4:6 or 4:7), and Instagram will crop your content.

Vertical poles take more real estate while someone parades through their home power, so they are more optimized than horizontal poles. However, it's good to keep in mind how they will appear once they are trimmed square in the Instagram profile grid.

With respect to size, we recommend using 1080px by 1350px. So when Instagram compresses the photo, it should show up at about 480px by 600px.

## **Instagram Post Size Guide2: Instagram Carousel Posts.**

![If the first photo you select is square (as shown above), all your following content will be cropped in 1:1 format.](/uploads/28.PNG "Instagram Post Size Guide2: Instagram Carousel Posts.")

Instagram carousel posts can be square, horizontal, or vertical and include photographs and videos.

However, after you select your first photo or video, all of the following images or videos you choose will be trimmed to the same format.

If the first photo you select is square (as shown above), all your following content will be cropped in 1:1 format.

## **Instagram Post Size Chart #3: Instagram Stories.**

You can share just about anything on Instagram Stories, as long as it has a minimum of 1.91:1 dimensions and a max of 9:16 dimensions.

Since most people prefer their stories to occupy the whole screen (no borders), we recommend using a 9:16 format with a size of 1080px by 1920px.

## **Instagram Post Size Guide 4: Instagram Clips.**

Instagram has recently merged the Feed and IGTVs videos into one format: Instagram Video.

By merging IGTV and Feed videos, Instagram has a unique destination for longer video content.

To support this shift, Instagram has introduced a number of new features for Instagram Video:

* A new Video tab for Profile.
* Trimming
* Option to download video subtitles.
* Identification of people and sites.
* 60-second Feed Previews

**Note:** Prevs will be limited to 15 seconds for streaming video ads.

Instagram supports stream movie previews with aspect ratios ranging from 16:9 to 4:5. Videos must have a frame rate of 30 frames per second and file size of up to 4GB.

After you nail down your Instagram video sizes, you can get your content out there with the Later Visual Instagram Planner.

It shows you exactly how your Instagram feed will look with your next posts (images and videos) - making it a game-changer to nail your aesthetics.

It allows you to easily rearrange or exchange your posts so that you can find the right balance for your Instagram feed.

Scheduling your messages in advance helps you maintain a consistent aesthetic and helps you publish regularly.

## **Instagram Post Size Chart 5: Instagram Reels.**

Like stories, Instagram scrolls are designed to be seen vertically on Fullscreen and mobile.

In this regard, we recommend using a 9:16 aspect ratio. Shooting and mounting directly on mobile is an excellent way to stay in optimum size.

**Hint:** The bottom fifth of a reel is where the video legend is displayed. Avoid significant visual features in this section if possible

.

## **Instagram Post Size Guide 6: Live Streaming.**

Instagram Live videos are designed to be taken vertically because they are designed to be played right from your mobile device.

It means that the aspect ratio will still be your screen's full width and height (which is usually 9:16).

Because you can't manually modify the size or aspect ratio of your Instagram Live videos, you don't have to worry too much.
