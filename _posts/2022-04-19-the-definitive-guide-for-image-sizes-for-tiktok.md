## **Cartoon PFP**

If you spend time browsing TikTok as a user, you will find that TikTok comic profile photos are very popular. Users will find a comic character to which they relate or which they take advantage of and use a picture of this character as a profile photo. You may be able to apply the same concept to your corporate account, or you may want to add a touch.

### **Default PFP**

Maybe a bit surprising, TikTok's default profile image makes a comeback as an option for many accounts to use rather than make a change. However, when using the TikTok default PFP, you can always add your own personalized style to that silhouette. Basically, the tendency is to use the shaded outline that you get as default for your profile photo. but to stylize it somehow to make it your own. For instance, if your business has a logo, you could add a cap to the default PFP. and place your logo at the front of the hat. This is just an idea of how you might join this trend while using something unique and recognizable.

### **Transparent PFP**

The use of a clear PFP is an excellent option on TikTok and one which could be especially suitable for your business. You may remove the background with several tools after you have an image you wish to use for your PFP. More details about these tools can be found later in this article.

### **Anime PFP**

Many profile pictures for TikTok are loaded with an animated theme. This could be a famous anime character or a personalized cartoon in an animated style. Anyway, it's a choice that will only make sense to a certain type of business.

A business in the entertainment field, for example, might be able to use a PFP anime and match it to everything else. However, this may not seem appropriate for other types of businesses. So think carefully about trying this strategy before proceeding.

### **Occasion Based PFP**

If it doesn't bother you to update your TikTok PFP business regularly, you may have a habit of updating this image often based on the time of year. Because profile photos for TikTok are easy to do and take just a moment to change. This is a relatively simple way of personalizing your account.

For example, you can create a memorable image when you have a significant sale or add a new profile for the holiday season. The possibilities are endless here, but you'll want to keep up with it so that you don't allow the PFP to get up to date. One of the ideas is to have a default PFP you use as your favorite option.

## **What happens if your TikTok is too small.**

Firstly, you can use image editing software, which will allow you to enlarge it, but the quality can be degraded. You can also create a new image, by targeting the perfect PFP TikTok dimensions of 200 x 200 pixels.

## **How to turn your TikTok into a GIF.**

While you are working on different PPP for TikTok, you might decide that a static image is a bit annoying. Instead, you may want to put your PFP on the move to attract attention and set yourself apart from the crowd. To do this, simply upload a video like PFP, instead of an image. This video should last between three and six seconds, and it will be looped, making it look like a GIF. The procedure is as follows:

1. Log in to your account and press "Me"
2. Find "Update Profile" and tap it.
3. Click "Upload Video" and choose the right file. If the video lasts more than 6 seconds. You will have to choose which six-second segment you want to use.
4. You're done!

## **Conclusion**

Is your personal TikTok FP the most important portion of your account? No. Of course, the designation is related to your content. The content you post to TikTok will greatly impact how your account works effectively as a marketing tool. That said, the PFP you choose is important because it can serve to promote your brand.

The bottom line is that creating an incredible PFP for TikTok shouldn't take all your time. However, doing things right is worthwhile. Hopefully, the information in this article will help you get started on the right path. Godspeed with this fun project!
