Facebook is now capable enough to support 3D photos in the News Feeds and VR headsets section. Facebook had already introduced this feature at its F8 developer conference in May 2018. The 3D photos feature is already in use for its end-users.

### What is Facebook 3D Photo All About?

Facebook 3D Photo is a new AI-powered feature that enables the user to share 3D photos on the social media platform Facebook. The effect can be utilized by using the portrait mode of an iPhone and other smartphones with a dual camera setup. This application uses portrait mode to render 2D photos in a 3D effect. The platform makes use of the dual lens setup that will give access to the use of information between the subject in focus and the background and foreground.

### How do we visualize the change?

Any person who is using the Facebook platform is able to create, view and share Facebook 3D photos. Users can even view these photos in VR (virtual reality) using the Oculus browser on Oculus Go or Firefox on Oculus Rift. To visualize the 3D photos on the smartphone, all you need to do is to scroll or tilt your device. These photos will also be available in Facebook News Feeds.

### What would be the Compatible devices?

To have access to Facebook’s 3D photos, you require an iOS device with a dual camera setup. Some of the devices, including iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max, support the feature. It is expected that the latest 3D photo feature will exist on Android flagship phones including Samsung Galaxy Note 9, OnePlus 6, LG V35, and many more.

### How to create and share Facebook’s 3D Photos?

Create a new Facebook post through the official Facebook application. For such, you have to tap on the three dots for more options and choose the 3D photo option. Now select the 3D Photo to view the iPhone’s gallery section; here, you can choose any photo you want to use as the portrait mode.

### How to master Facebook 3D photos?

• Make sure that the object is at least 3 to 4 feet away.

• Capture the image with multiple layers of depth

• Ensure that the subject has contrasting colors

• The subject with some texture and solid edges is best for 3D photos.
