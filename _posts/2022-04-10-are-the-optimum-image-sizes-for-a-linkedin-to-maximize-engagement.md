#### What is the importance of adding pictures to our LinkedIn messages? While LinkedIn is traditionally word-driven, not image-driven, it is still important to post images on LinkedIn.

#### 

#### You can draw another audience or a larger audience if you add images to your LinkedIn posts. Also, please keep in mind, there are many LinkedIn areas where you almost need to add a photo. In many places on LinkedIn – in posts as well as in profiles – LinkedIn provides a picture of a "place holder" for you to add your own. There is no requirement to add your image to these locations, but if not, you will display the default LinkedIn image. It does not seem very attractive, but you miss out on a fantastic marketing opportunity by not adding your image.

#### You can add your logo, picture or any other image to emphasize your authority or offer your audience another way to get to know you better.

#### 

#### Don't turn up for that meeting or interview 'wearing someone else's shirt', don't rely on the LinkedIn default image – create one of your own which tells your audience something about you. To save you time, I've prepared a complete picture size guide that you may need to use on LinkedIn. I've divided them into categories for your convenience. Don't forget that personal profiles have different image sizes than company pages!

## **Company cover photo**

##### LinkedIn professional profiles are governed by slightly different rules of personal LinkedIn photos. Companies tend to want to embed their logos in their LinkedIn banners. There is not as much diversity as on individual pages. The size of the LinkedIn banner for a business page differs from the size of the LinkedIn cover picture on a personal profile. The recommended size of a LinkedIn cover photo is 1400 x 425 pixels, a subtle but significant difference.

### Once you have configured your profile, it may be helpful for you to incorporate LinkedIn advertisements into your growth plan. LinkedIn's ad targeting enables users to be very precise with their audience. Companies that need to target by occupation, tenure, industry and title can do so reliably with the LinkedIn advertising platform.

### This section will explain how to get started with LinkedIn advertising, the dimensions of advertising on LinkedIn, the different advertising formats and how to design them.

## **How you can start advertising on Linkedin.**

1. In the top right corner of your homepage, next to the "Work" icon, you will find the "Advertising" icon. Click there.
2. Create a new account and select the type of campaign you want to launch. You can choose either self-service or managed campaigns.

## **-Tips**

### **LinkedIn design tips**

* With a wide variety of advertising formats, media types and audience targeting, one can safely say that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for LinkedIn advertising.
* The most important thing to remember when designing social publications and LinkedIn ads is to create coherently. It makes your ads more recognizable and reinforces your brand equity over time.

  ![Tips  LinkedIn design tips](/uploads/105.PNG "Tips  ")
* The ad size in the LinkedIn carousel is 1080 x 1080 pixels or a 1:1 look ratio. Carousel images serve to tell a story or present a range of products.
* There are fewer opportunities for highlighting a product but more chances that your audience will spend more time clicking on the ad if they are interested.
* There are several different sizes for LinkedIn videos, but the 3 main options are landscape (1920 x 1080 pixels), square (1080 x 1080 pixels), and vertical (1080 x 1920 pixels).
* You may consult the official LinkedIn video sizing resource for more information on specific formats and sizes.
* Videos are a great tool to capture an audience's attention, tell your brand's story, shine a light on company culture, and, of course, can be used if you have a specific feature that you want to highlight.

## **LinkedIn personal account**

### The same principles govern personal LinkedIn accounts as commercial pages. You always represent a brand, except now it's your brand rather than a company. Stay professional and display your experience in a proper way for your industry.

### The two pictures you will need for your Linkedin personal profile are a profile picture and a background picture. Sizing and image design are critical to your professional performance.

## **-FAQs**

## **How to post the story on LinkedIn.**

### Using the LinkedIn mobile app, click on the 'My Story' icon below the search bar under your profile photo. You can save/capture a picture directly in the app or upload an image or video from your film. Users can also share their stories with first-degree connections via LinkedIn messaging as long as it is within the 24-hour history display window.

## **How you can create your LinkedIn profile.**

### It's easy to start with your profile: go to the LinkedIn home page and enter your basic details to create a shape. Once you have uploaded your profile picture and background photo, it's time to start adding your experience. The best way to think about it is to copy your résumé. Share your experience in chronological order and your educational background and volunteer experience. Also, try to include brief descriptions of the company and your job to help viewers better understand your experience.

## **How big is the image on the LinkedIn carousel?**

### The ad size in the LinkedIn carousel is 1080 x 1080 pixels or a 1:1 look ratio. Carousel pictures are used to tell a story or display various products. There are fewer opportunities to promote a product, but it is more likely that your audience will spend more time clicking the ad if they are interested.

### There are several different sizes for LinkedIn videos, but the 3 main options are landscape (1920 x 1080 pixels), square (1080 x 1080 pixels), and vertical (1080 x 1920 pixels). You can check out LinkedIn's official video sizing resource for more information about specific formats and sizes. Videos are a great tool to capture an audience's attention, tell your brand's story, shine a light on company culture, and, of course, can be used if you have a specific feature that you want to highlight.
