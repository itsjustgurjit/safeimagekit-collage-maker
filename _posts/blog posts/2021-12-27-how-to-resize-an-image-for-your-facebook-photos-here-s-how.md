# **How To Resize an image for Your Facebook Photos - Here's How**

## **Introduction**

The majority of people who have an online presence already have a Facebook profile. The social media website has grown to the point where it has become an integral part of our daily lives. People can find people from all over the world, engage with them, and communicate with them at any time. However, you must be able to see the people you're looking for in order to locate them.

This is when having a decent Facebook profile photo and cover photo comes in handy. When people start looking for you, the profile image is the first thing they see, and the cover photo is something that provides them a deeper peek into your life, interests, or tastes. Both of these graphic parts of your profile are communication methods that you can use to connect with others who share your interests.

Facebook has become an indispensable aspect of everyone's online existence. The majority of active online clients begin and conclude their days by visiting Facebook. There's no denying that everyone wants their profile to look great, which is why Facebook is continually updated with new photos and other relevant media data.

## **Image sizes that are recommended for personal profiles**

When posting to Facebook, make sure that each image looks good for your supporters, friends, and followers to see. The following image widths are officially supported by Facebook, and Nasim Mansurov, author and founder of Photography Life, reminds us that link thumbnails and profile photographs have pre-determined dimensions as well:

Photos for status updates: 720px, 960px, and 2048px

Photos for the cover: 851 px by 315 px

Thumbnails: 484 px by 252 px

The profile picture in the header: 180 px by 180 px

A little explanation in simpler words: The Facebook cover image is the first thing you see when you sign up for a Facebook account. That is why having a great image as a cover photo is so vital. However, cover pictures have a somewhat awkward size— 851 x 315 pixels— and you can't upload any other image of any size.

Every day, Facebook users post around 350 million images. Facebook reduces the size of your photographs to accommodate those files at scale, so they might not be as clear as the original version. However, adhering to the permitted photo sizes ensures that the visuals you post are as good as they can be.

**"If you utilize a 2048 px photo, make sure to select the High-Quality option when uploading it," the business says. Make sure the file size of your cover photo is less than 100 KB to avoid compression."**

## **Image sizes that are recommended for business profiles**

Now, if you are a business owner using Facebook to sell your products, you might be interested in knowing the dimensions recommended for Facebook ads.

The size of your Facebook ad image will be determined by the type of ad you're intending to make.

There are three standard measurements:

**Website click ad:** If you're making a link-based ad, 1200 x 627 pixels is the optimum picture size.

If you're running a **Facebook like ad**, use the same image size as your cover photo: 851 x 315 pixels.

**Event ad:** Your event's cover image is also used in event ads. 851 x 315 pixels is the optimal size.
