# **\[Simple Steps\] Discover the Easiest Way to Convert text to Image**

## **Introduction**

Are you someone who wishes they could transform words into images? Then you've landed at the right place. Isn't it interesting that the paper hasn't vanished in this digital age of tablets, iPads, and Kindles? While it fascinates me, it can be concerning to others.

A question may arise: how will handwritten and paper version documents stay up in this age of widespread adoption of the digital culture? Fortunately, thanks to technological advancements, we now have a remedy- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

## **What Does Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Mean?**

Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a complex software method that allows a machine to translate paper documents, handwriting, or static images into customizable PDFs. The OCR software used to be quite incorrect and, as a consequence, untrustworthy.

However, with the progress of technology, many learners, researchers, instructors, doctors, lawyers, and office employees increasingly use OCR software as a productivity hack. Despite the fact that 100 percent precision has yet to be reached, a near approximation is what most people need.

## **A few ways to convert text to Image**

**Method 1:**

Any phrase in this text has to be double-clicked. The text will be highlighted on your screen, and you can then copy and paste it into your document processor or email application. Alternatively, try double-clicking any of the words in this article's graphics. It's not going to work. There's a considerable difference between genuine text and a picture that includes text in the virtual environment, even if it's not necessarily clear to the user.

Let's begin by converting text to a bitmapped image, such as a.jpg or.png. This is a really straightforward procedure. Choose the text you wish to "capture" and transfer it to the clipboard using CTRL-C. This is the free image editor that arrives with Windows. You may launch Paint 3D in Windows 10 or just launch normal Paint if you are using Windows 8.1 and below. Then save the file by pressing CTRL-V to paste the text as an image.

**Method 2:**

If you're using Microsoft Word, we've found that this works best with older versions of Windows. Nevertheless, it should work with almost any text-displaying program on Windows 10. If this approach doesn't work in another program, you could use Windows' Snipping Tool to take any part of the screen and save it as an image.

In case your Windows version isn't updated and the Snipping Tool does not exist, you can simply hit the Print Screen button on your keypad, then launch Paint (or another image editor) and paste the picture. You'll want to trim the picture to just the words because it saves the entire screen.
