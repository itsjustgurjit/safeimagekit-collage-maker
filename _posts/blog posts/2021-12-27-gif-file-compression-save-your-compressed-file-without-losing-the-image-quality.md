# **GIF File Compression - Save your Compressed file without losing the image quality**

## **Introduction**

When uploading animated GIF files to Twitter, keep in mind that the file size limit is 15MB from the web and 5MB from a mobile phone. How can a GIF be compressed while retaining its original quality?

Due to their unique animation and quick transfer, GIF files are now an indispensable tool on the Web. When converting a movie to an animated GIF, however, the GIF files should be huge. Simply read the post to discover more about compressing GIFs.

**What is a GIF Compressor, and how does it work?**

Within just a fraction of a second, GIFs express emotions that take around ten seconds to write. As JPG, PNG, and other image formats create and show static images, they occupy less space than GIFs. Images in which the items in the picture do not move are known as static images.

A dynamic image is something like a video or a GIF. GIFs can alternatively be described as a one-second rendition of a video with the sole purpose of conveying a message via the usage of expressions. Audio is normally not included in GIFs because it takes much more storage than usual.

It's critical to reduce GIFs before uploading them if you're developing a website that relies on them to convey information. Because of the enormous file size of GIFs, they will take longer to load on your website, affecting its overall quality. So, if you want to attract more clients who appreciate reading your articles or visiting your site, turn to the compressors.

## **How does this process work?**

The technology that allows a GIF size reduction to work is quite intricate. To put it differently, a predetermined algorithm is used to reduce the colour and shape of things. This is accomplished without sacrificing image quality.

An excellent GIF Compressor makes use of innovative technology to maintain the image quality. Engineers employ the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technology. We have made the size reducing software discussed in this post using the same approach.
