WordPress plugins are essentially bits of code that “plugs in” to your self-hosted WordPress site. Hence, comes to the name “plugins”.In layman terms, a WordPress plugin is something that adds new functionality to your WordPress site or extends existing functionality on your site.

# **What is image compression?**

Image compression is a process of reducing the size of the image by lowering its quality. Although the quality is only lowered to such a level that the image can still be clearly seen and accepted. This reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space. It also reduces the time required for images to be sent over the Internet or downloaded from Web pages.

We use image compressors to compress an image. Each image compressor may work differently as there are various techniques of compressing an image where each technique differs from the other in terms of the amount of compression and the output quality.
