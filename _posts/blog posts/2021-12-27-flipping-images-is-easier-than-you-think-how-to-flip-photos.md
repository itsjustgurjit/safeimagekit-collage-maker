# **Flipping Images Is Easier Than You Think - How To Flip Photos**

## **What is the definition of a flipped image?**

A mirrored or reversed version of the original shot is one that flips across a vertical axis. The picture can also be rotated about its horizontal axis to create an upside-down reproduction of the original photograph. Some people distinguish the two by calling the former a "flopped" picture.
