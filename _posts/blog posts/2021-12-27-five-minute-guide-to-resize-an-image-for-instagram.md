## **Introduction**

The majority of people who have an online presence already have an Instagram profile. The social media app has grown to the point where it has become an integral part of our daily lives.

If you are a fan of Instagram, you must have noticed how Instagram often reduces the size of your pictures, whenever you try to post them. And we know exactly how frustrating that can be.

It can get very annoying when you try to post a picture of your cat playing with the yarn, but all Instagram lets you post is just the yarn and your cat’s tail! Or you try to post a selfie as your profile photo but Instagram just won’t let you post it in any ratio other than 1:1, hence zooming in to just your eyes and nose! Sigh, been there done that!

So, in this article, we are here to help you get an idea of the basic Instagram post sizes and then show you exactly how you can achieve that using our Instagram photo resizer tool.

Instagram maintains the original size of your photo at a standard width of 1080 pixels, as long as the height is between 566 and 1350 pixels. Your photo will be expanded if it is less than 320 pixels wide. It will be resized if it is larger than 1080 pixels wide. If your post isn't square, as long as the image's proportions are as recommended, your picture will seem as it should - it's all about ratios, really.

Instagram Ad (single picture or carousel): 1080 x 1080 px

Instagram Post (1:1 ratio): 1080 × 1080 px

Photo for Instagram profile: 360 × 360 px
