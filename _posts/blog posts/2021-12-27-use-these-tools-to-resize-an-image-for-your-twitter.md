# **Use these tools to resize an image for your Twitter**

## **Introduction**

In case you are new to Twitter or if you already have a profile and want to upgrade your photographs, you are in the right place. You can use photographs in your profile, header, and adverts on Twitter, but they must be within the size restrictions to avoid cropping.

Twitter, like other social networking networks, has some picture restrictions and suggested proportions. You'll need to resize your image ahead of time to ensure it preserves its original quality and isn't cropped in all the incorrect places.
