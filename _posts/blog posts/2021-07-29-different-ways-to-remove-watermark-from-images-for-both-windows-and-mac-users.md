**Watermark** is a kind of marker covertly embedded in a noise-tolerant signal such as audio, video, or image data. It is typically used to identify ownership of the copyright of such signal. The process of watermarking digital media such as video, audio, images, etc. has been inspired from the late 1800s through watermarking letters, postal stamps, currency notes, etc. Digital watermarks may be used to verify the authenticity or integrity of the carrier signal or to show the identity of its owners. It is prominently used for tracing copyright infringements and for banknote authentication.

Most of the image templates, videos, and audio files are always watermarked till the end. So, when we need an ‘inspiration’ from these files, we cannot take them on reference into our work because of the watermark of its creators.
