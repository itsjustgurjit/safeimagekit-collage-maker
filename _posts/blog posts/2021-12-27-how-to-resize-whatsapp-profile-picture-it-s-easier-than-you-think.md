# **How To Resize WhatsApp Profile Picture - It's Easier Than You Think**

## **Introduction**

Trying to post your most recent photo to your WhatsApp profile, but it keeps getting cropped? This occurs because WhatsApp only supports a set resolution for the profile image, and any image larger than that must be cropped. If you don't want to crop your image, you'll have to enlarge it for your WhatsApp profile.
