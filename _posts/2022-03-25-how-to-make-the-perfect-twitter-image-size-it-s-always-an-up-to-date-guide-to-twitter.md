Twitter has updated its suggested image sizes ONCE AGAIN. If you're behind on the last Twitter updates, it's time to catch up. Social media platforms are changing their algorithms and interfaces all the time. Content developers and marketers must be proactive and stay abreast of the latest news. While this is a small part of the user experience, image size matters greatly on social media. Incorrect image dimensions can lead to poorly adapted or cropped content. The target platform can reject your carefully edited pictures if they are not optimized for size.

In this article, we've compiled a Twitter Picture Size Job Aid with updated information for 2022.

The guide covers everything below, and you may skip directly to the section you find relevant:

* Profile, header, and tweet image sizes
* Twitter Card image size
* Twitter ad image size
* Twitter Moments

## **-Image size & Aspect ratio**

Twitter has mandated sizes and aspect ratios for the header, profile and display images. If you don't meet the standards, your photos may appear distorted, cropped, or unbalanced, which puts your brand in a bad light.

To bring your best face to the forefront, follow these picture sizes, specifications, and best practices:

## **-Twitter post size guide**

Before mentioning the optimal image size, we identified a few good practices that you should follow to get messages rich in impeccable images for Twitter:

* Do not use third-party websites that purport to show how your image will be displayed on multiple devices. This doesn't ever work.
* Test your image on as many devices as you can get your hands on, from desktops to tablets and other mobile devices.
* Use a private account to check images of your tweets before posting them to your public statement. Additional effort can save you a lot of trouble.
* If you're pressed for time, optimize your images for mobile in priority. People usually access social apps on mobile devices and rarely click to see full-size photos.
* Twitter can narrow down your image, so it fits into the stream. Make sure to centre the important content so it is not cut.

The ideal picture size and format are 1200px X 675px and 16:9 respectively. The file size is up to 5 MB for photos and animated GIFs. You can go as high as 15MB if you post via their website.

## **Twitter profile, header post**

Size of the profile, header and tweet. If you don't follow the standards, your images can appear asymmetric, cropped or unbalanced, showing your brand badly.

To bring your best face to the forefront, follow these picture sizes, specifications, and best practices:

### Profile Picture

![Twitter post size guide](/uploads/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-842554.jpg "Twitter Profile Picture")

In 2017, Twitter moved from square profile images into round profile images. Today, the standard 2:1 format is not acceptable on Twitter anymore. Your avatar will now have an aspect ratio of 1:1. The recommended size is always 400 px X 400 px, and the allowed formats are JPG, PNG and GIF. The maximum file size is 2 megabytes.

## **Twitter card image size**

Twitter creates a rich Twitter card when you display a link with a featured image at the top. A compressed shape of the picture is incorporated in the tweet. You can adjust the image placement not to cut the captions when the message appears in the stream. Like avatars, tweeted pictures do not follow the 2:1 format. Instead, they should adapt to sizes of 1.91:1 or 1200px X 628px.

Note that you may not choose to create a Twitter map. These are generated automatically if you publish from a website that enabled the "twitter:card" property in their HTML.

## **Twitter Ads image sign**

Marketing specialists and contractors use Twitter for lead generation and sales conversion. Twitter makes things easier for them by offering lead generation maps and website maps, also called "ads." Like the Twitter maps, the ads also have a visual attraction. They distinguish themselves in congested streams and encourage viewers to perform the desired actions.

We will not take a close look at how these ads work. Instead, we will focus on the disposition specifications that you should follow.

### Photo Size for Lead Generation Maps.

Lead generation maps have an offer, an image, a call to action and an option to collect user names and email addresses. An image size of 800px X 200px is recommended. The Call to Action can be customized as required.

## **Twitter moments**

As with Instagram Highlights, Twitter allows you to keep your favourite tweets as Twitter Moments. You can create a collection of customer reviews, product collections, vacation photography and event launches, such as Moments. Let's look at how you can conceive and optimize your "moments".

You can go to Twitter Moments by clicking on the More tab (indicated by a horizontal ellipse) and then selecting Moments from the menu. Every Moment is saved as a slide show with a cover picture. You can also share your time via tweets.

## **Tweet image size**

The perfect image size and format are 1200px X 675px and 16:9 respectively. The max file size is 5 MB for photos and animated GIFs. You can go as high as 15MB if you display through their website.

You can tweet up to four images per message. Two pictures are displayed side by side, with a 7:8 aspect ratio.

## **-How to resize the image to Twitter**

Twitter recommends an image format of 3:1, a size of 1500px X px and file size of up to 5MB. The images may be JPG, PNG or GIFs (but not animated GIFs). You can change your banner image on mobile devices or desktop computers, but you will have to use the Twitter website if you want to update the colour of the theme.

Try Twitter's FREE Image Resizer tool to resize your pictures to the suitable sizes and sizes for Twitter ads.

## **-PRO TIPS**

Try to maintain a consistent profile image on your social accounts to improve brand recognition. As well, avoid using logos or quotes in your avatar. It is preferable to use a full front photo on a clean background. Bring your best face forward and experiment with different angles for the most flattering head.

### Image Size for Website Cards

If your goal is to stimulate traffic to your website, website maps are an excellent solution. They contain a website banner image, a description and a direct link. Alternatively, you can choose from a series of predefined calls to action to add to your ad. Twitter prescribes size of 800px X 320px for website advertisement pictures.

## **-FAQs**

### **What is the aspect to size ratio for a Twitter profile photo?**

The standard aspect ratio for a Twitter profile photo is a 1:1 aspect ratio (it is no longer 2:1). However, the recommendation is always 400 px X 400 px. You can use JPG, PNG or GIF, as long as the file size does not exceed 2MB.

### **How can I adjust the image's width using the Twitter image resizer feature from** [**safeimagekit.com**](https://safeimagekit.com/image-resize-twitter)**?**

The first step is to load the image which needs editing. The next step is to adjust the basic settings of the idea, which entails adjusting the width. Now, to access this option, you need to select a category from all the versions and hit the edit option to begin the editing; then, there will be a pop-up wherein you can drag in and adjust the image's width. The bonus feature is that we can zoom in and out to control the required content of the picture simply by scrolling forward and backwards.

### **How should I use Twitter to generate leads?**

You can use Twitter track generation maps or website maps to generate tracks. These Twitter advertising images distinguish themselves in congested feeds and motivate users to complete specific calls to action. A lead generation map is 800px X 200px and features an offer, picture, CTA and option to collect users' names and email addresses. A website map is 800px X 320 px and has a website's banner image, a description, a direct link, and a predefined DEC.

### **What is a Twitter Moment?**

The moments are reactive and will alter their orientation depending on the size of the screen where they are viewed. The moments are reactive and will change their orientation depending on the size of the screen in which they are displayed. You can build a collection of customer reviews, product collections, holiday photos and event launches as Twitter Moments. Although, rather not use second-party tweets as it could cause issues with copyright infringement.

At this time, Twitter has not set image size for Moments. This means that you can include pictures, videos and GIFs of various sizes in one Moment. But we think the 9:16 vertical aspect ratio is the best.

The moments are receptive; they change their orientation according to the size of the screen in which they are viewed. Make sure the cover photograph is captivating.

You can select an image from the Moment collection or download it from your camera gallery. Static images are better than animated GIFs or images with captions.

### **How do I set up a Twitter Moment?**

To access the Twitter Moments feature, click the Plus tab, select Moments from the pop-up menu, and select "Create New Moment" on the Moments page. The "Edit Moment" page will open, where you will be able to specify a title, add a captivating static cover photo and select the tweets you want to add to your Moment. Currently, you can include videos, images and GIFs in different sizes (although a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio seems best).
